    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm just getting started...I am a lifelong student. I have experience in Bayesian statistics (STAN and Base R), geospatial analysis (R and python), and surface water modeling (HEC-RAS). As a postdoctoral scientist, I expand on my work as a doctoral student by examining groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDE) through the lens of scale-enlightened modeling. Hypothesis testing is used to investigate how small scale GDE processes translates to larger spatial scales.
